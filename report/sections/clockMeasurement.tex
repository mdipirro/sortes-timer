\section{System clock frequency measurement}
The clock frequency of the board that is being used (Olimex PIC-MAXI-WEB) is set at boot time by the tftp server. To know exactly at what frequency the board is running, a test routine has been performed with an ad-hoc software (\texttt{clkfreq.c}).

To take the measurement another time reference is needed; the basic idea is to count how many execution clock ticks happen in a certain period and obtain the frequency from the inverse relationship.

In addition to the main clock, a second - low-frequency - oscillator (32.768 kHz) is present inside the Olimex board; using the full 16-bit register it is possible to count up to 2 seconds.

The \texttt{timer1} has been configured to make use of the external oscillator and generate a period of 2 seconds, while the \texttt{timer0} counts each execution clock tick on a 8 bit register; whenever the latter counter is full, an Interrupt Service Routine is called to increase a variable, which thus represents the number of overflows of the \texttt{timer0}.\\

After the predefined period (2 seconds) has passed, the value of the overflow variable is printed on the LCD screen. The clock frequency can be calculated using these formulas:

$$ f_{clk,exec} = \frac{t0\_overflows \cdot 2^8}{2}\, \left[{\frac{ticks}{seconds} = Hz}\right]$$
$$ f_{clk,sys} = 4 \cdot f_{clk,exec}\,\left[Hz\right] $$

The testing routine has been executed on the board; after a (short) startup stabilization time, the display shows a value equal to:
$$ t0\_overflows = 48825 $$
Which leads to $f_{clk,exec} = 6.2496\,MHz$ and $f_{clk,sys} = 24.9984\,Mhz \approx 25\,Mhz$.\\

A couple of final considerations on this method:

\begin{itemize}
	\item With the current registers configuration, the system clock measurement range is from $512\,Hz$ to $33.55\,MHz$. Precedent experiments had been performed to make sure that the clock frequency was inside this range (it can be set up to $41.667\,MHz$ on the Olimex board).
	\item Being the number of overflows very high, the measurement uncertainty is quite low; even assuming an uncertainty equal to 50 overflows (12800 ticks!) the relative error is around 0.1\%.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{clkfreq.c listing}
\texttt{clkfreq.c} is the C file containing the program measuring the clock frequency. Listing~\ref{lst:clkfreq} lists the code.
