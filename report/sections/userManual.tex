\section{User manual}
\subsection{Initial setting}
To set both the clock's time and the awake time the user can use the two buttons provided by the board. Both the setting procedures comprise two steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item set hours, and
	\item set minutes.
\end{itemize}
Seconds are always supposed to start from zero (0). Below is the procedure to follow:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Press \textbf{BUT2} to set the hours value;
	\item Press \textbf{BUT1} to save the value, and start setting the minutes;
	\item Press \textbf{BUT2} to set the minutes value;
	\item Press \textbf{BUT1} to save the clock's time and start setting the awake time.
\end{enumerate}
The procedure for setting the awake time is the same. The board displays two different messages according to the actual procedure, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Enter the time}, for the clock's time;
	\item \textit{Enter the awake time}, for the awake time.
\end{itemize}
Once completed the initial settings, the display shows the time, in the format \textit{hh:mm:ss}. 

\subsection{Change clock's or awake time}
Users cannot modify an already saved value during the initial setting. In order to correct mistakes a user has to complete the procedure and then modify specifically the wrongly-provided time. This can be done using the two buttons, with the following mapping:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{BUT1} allows the user to modify the clock's time, and
	\item \textbf{BUT2} allows the user to modify the awake time.
\end{itemize}
The steps to follow are the same as the aforementioned ones. The display shows a different message according to the actual chosen procedure. After completion, seconds start again from zero. 

\subsection{Ringing}
Ringing is replaced by a blinking led (WHICH ONE????????). The blinking duration is set to 30 seconds. After that the led stops blinking and the timer will wake up after 24 hours, unless the user sets the awake differently.
